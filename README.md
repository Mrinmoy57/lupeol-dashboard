# Inner-Rx
Our AI-powered web application revolutionizes novel drug discovery.  It streamlines research, accelerates development, and fosters collaboration, ultimately leading to faster cures and groundbreaking new medicines.
Inner Rx is a sophisticated web application designed to assist researchers and pharmaceutical industries in the drug design and analysis process, specifically targeting Alzheimer's disease. The application leverages the power of data visualization, machine learning predictions, and comprehensive data analysis to provide valuable insights into drug formulation, efficacy, and delivery pathways.

Key Features:
Drug Prediction Data:

Data Visualization: The application visualizes detailed information about the drug formulation, including the plant source, phytochemicals, target molecules, target diseases, dosage details, temperature and pH conditions, shelf life, drug efficacy, side effects, and delivery pathways.
Interactive Tables: Users can interact with tables displaying the drug data, making it easier to analyze and compare different drug formulations.
Price Calculation Results:

Cost Analysis: The application calculates the price per capsule and price per strip for both children's and adults' dosages. This helps researchers and pharmaceutical companies understand the cost implications of drug production.
Market Comparison: The application provides a comparison of the drug prices with other market-available drugs, giving a clearer picture of the competitive landscape.
Pathway Diagrams:

Alzheimer's Disease Pathway: The application visualizes the pathway diagram for Alzheimer's disease, including key genes such as APP, PSEN1, APOE, and BACE1. This helps researchers understand the molecular interactions and pathways involved in the disease.
Neurons Cluster Diagram: The application displays a synthetic data-based neurons cluster diagram, color-coded by different lobes. This visualization aids in understanding the complex neural networks and their connections.
Drug Delivery Pathway: The application illustrates the drug delivery pathway, from oral administration to the target site, showcasing the journey of the drug within the body.
Research Articles:

Article Fetching: Users can input a gene name to fetch related research articles from the PubMed database. This feature provides easy access to the latest scientific literature and research findings.
How Inner Rx Works:
Data Input and Processing:

The application uses sample data for drug formulation and prediction, which is processed using a Spark session to handle large datasets efficiently.
Machine Learning Predictions:

The application includes a placeholder prediction function that simulates the process of predicting drug designs based on the input data. This function can be extended and integrated with actual machine learning models for more accurate predictions.
Visualization and Interaction:

The application is built using Dash, a powerful Python framework for building web applications. It leverages Plotly for interactive data visualizations, allowing users to explore and interact with the data seamlessly.
Security and Encryption:

The application uses the cryptography library to encrypt sensitive API keys, ensuring secure communication with external databases and APIs.
Why Inner Rx is Valuable:
Comprehensive Analysis: Inner Rx provides a holistic view of drug design, from formulation to delivery, making it a valuable tool for researchers and pharmaceutical companies.
Interactive and User-Friendly: The application is designed to be user-friendly, with interactive tables and visualizations that make data analysis intuitive and accessible.
Research Integration: By integrating research articles, Inner Rx helps users stay updated with the latest scientific findings, fostering informed decision-making.
Inner Rx is a powerful tool that combines data science, machine learning, and interactive visualizations to revolutionize the drug design process. It is designed to be a valuable resource for researchers and pharmaceutical industries, helping them develop effective treatments for Alzheimer's disease and beyond.
